# Orion Mini remote controller software

## Project description

Orion Mini is a small rover constructed by Dr. Marcin Maciejewski (from Lublin University of Technology) for his kids to play with. Since his software ([which is also available in this repository](old_code)) looks like made in stone age, i decided to rewrite everything and make it possibly faster, easier to modify/expand and slightly modular.

## Repository

In [docs](docs) directory you can find documentation of the project, mostly description of hardware and communication.

In [include](include) directory, i've put global headers, like constants.

All the libraries written by me for this project can be found in [lib](lib) directory.

[old_code](old_code) contains original code of the rover and remote.

[src](src) contains `main.cpp` file

[test](test) directory contains various test files

You can find all the images used in documentation files in [media](media) directory.
